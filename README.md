# Further possibilities:

## Add a search box -- adjust listing on each character input
* by name(, other attributes?)

## Add new section at bottom of recipe (and edit section) for who created the recipe
* similar to ingredients (could be multiple authors)

## useEffect to connect to (Ruby on Rails) backend and PostgreSQL
* minimal changes needed (just in useEffect functions)
